# Economic Model



There are essentially two profit centers in the Flex Ecosystem:&#x20;

* Flex Exchange
* Flex Market Maker

## Flex Exchange&#x20;

The Flex Exchange collects a configurable percentage fee for processing each transaction in the Order Book.

## Flex Market Maker&#x20;

The Flex Market Maker by providing liquidity to the Order Book facilitates the process of finding a fair price for a pair of tokens and ensures that market participants have a trading partner. If the fair price is found, the market maker would earn the price difference between their bid and ask prices when participants trade against them. The market maker may also earn a maker fee from the exchange for providing liquidity.
