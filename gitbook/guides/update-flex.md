# Update Flex

There are two types of updates in Flex.

DApp updates are frequent and straightforward. The DApp will display a notification about the available update in the top right corner of the main screen. Download the suggested package and install it as usual.

On the other hand, occasionally the on-chain contracts of the Flex exchange itself will be updated. To continue trading, you will have to sync your account with the updated Flex contracts. Follow the guide below to complete this update.

## Update Flex account

When Flex has undergone a contract update, you will see the following screen once you log into your Flex account:

Scan the QR code or click **Open Surf app** and proceed to the Flex DeBot in Surf.

This will cancel all your open orders and return the funds reserved in them to your Flex balances.
{% endhint %}

Depending on whether you have any open orders, and on how extensive the required update is, the DeBot will perform one or more update steps and ask you to confirm a few transactions. The fees for all update actions will be paid from your Gas balance.

Once done, it will report success and display the usual Flex DeBot menu.

Now you can return to Flex and continue trading on the updated exchange.
