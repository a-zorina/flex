# Get EVERs

Currently Flex works with a [Surf](https://ever.surf/) wallet. Get it for a device of your choice and [activate](https://help.ever.surf/en/support/solutions/articles/77000508953-how-to-activate-your-profile-in-surf-) your account.

Then get some EVERs on your Surf:

* you can [buy](https://help.ever.surf/en/support/solutions/articles/77000513727-how-do-i-top-up-my-surf-wallet-balance-using-a-bank-payment-card-) some in Surf directly
* you can use the [bridge](https://octusbridge.io/) to transfer coins from some other network to Everscale, and then send the coins you transferred to Surf
* you can participate on some community contests or airdrops

Optionally, you can also accumulate some [TIP3](https://help.ever.surf/en/support/solutions/articles/77000525744-tip3-tokens-in-surf) tokens on your Surf account. If they are listed on Flex, you will be able to deposit and trade them.
{% endhint %}

Once you have some EVERs (overview of the costs of using FLEX can be found [here](../flex-fees.md)) on your **main Surf balance**, you are ready to [connect your wallet](connect-your-wallet.md):
